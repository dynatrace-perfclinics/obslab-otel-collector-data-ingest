## Query and View Observability Data

In Dynatrace, press `Ctrl + k` again and search for `Notebooks`.

Create a new notebook and add a new section exploring the logs.

Add a new section and choose `Query Grail`. This section type allows you to write your own Dynatrace Query Language (DQL) to have full control over the data you retrieve.

Type: `fetch spans` in the DQL box and execute the query.
